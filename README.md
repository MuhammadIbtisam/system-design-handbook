# System Design Handbook

System Design Handbook is a practical, interview-focused guide for designing scalable, reliable systems.
It is built for engineers preparing for senior software engineering interviews and for those who want to learn how real-world systems are designed at scale.

This repository focuses on:

- Breaking down complex system design problems into clear, structured steps

- Explaining architectural decisions and trade-offs

- Teaching how to communicate designs effectively in interviews

- Using real-world examples instead of purely theoretical explanations

The goal of this handbook is not just to help you design systems, but to help you think and explain like a senior engineer.
